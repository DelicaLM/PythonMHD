PythonMHD: A New Simulation Code for Astrophysical Magnetohydrodynamics
By Delica Leboe-McGowan, PhD Student, University of Manitoba

PythonMHD is a compressible, adiabatic hydrodynamic and ideal MHD simulation code
for astrophysics.

Please see the PythonMHD user guide for details on installation, setup, and the 
algorithms that PythonMHD uses to accurately model astrophysical gas systems.
